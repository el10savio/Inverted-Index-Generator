# Inverted-Index-Generator
An Inverted Index generator implemented in Go

An inverted index is used to quickly do text searches in a lot of documents. 
It is done in Full Text Search Engines such as ElasticSearch. It does so by creating a table of each word, its frequency and all the documents it has appeared in.
